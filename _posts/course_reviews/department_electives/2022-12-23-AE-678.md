# Spring 2022
### Prof. P M Mujumdar
**Author**: Goparaju Khushal

**Pre-requisite courses**: AE 227, AE 225, AE 305

**Pre-requisite skills**: Basic Coding

**Course Content**:
Please refer to asc for this

**Motivation to take up the course**: Very important concept to learn from application perspective

---

**Course Evaluation Structure**:
2 Assignments, first one is easy, second one is more of a project and needs lot of effort and quite difficult. But what you learn from it is a relevant  application of static aeroelasticity to a real aircraft wing!

**Quizzes/Midsem/Endsem papers Difficulty**: 5/5

**Assignments/Project Difficulty**: 5/5

**General funda**: Please don't take this course alone, have a friend to discuss things with. Take it in a sem with no other effort demanding courses, because the effort needed for this is equivalent to a course worth 18 credits. That being said the content of the course is so worthy, and if possible do not miss out on the experience 

**Professor's Teaching Style**: Prof's teaching is very good, OP in the subject, can always approach him to discuss anything. Student friendly and always interested in students learning. When it comes to lectures, since he tries to teach a lot, he takes three 1.5 hrs classes a week, which with discussion and all end up going to 2 hrs. The subject is simple to learn but difficult to implement. To be expected from a proper advanced engineering type course which uses all the basics we learn in first 3 yrs of UG.

**Should you do this course?**: 
Any one interested in multidisciplinary problems, Interested in structures, aerodynamics or flight controls
